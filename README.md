# CS409_Assignment

This project was one of my university assignments which heavily focused on learning, detecting, and using design patterns in the programming process, as well as discovering inappropriate code errors before the code is compiled.

Here, I added automatic detection of inappropriate intimacy, large class, long method, long parameter list, all of which are bad practices (or code smells as some would call them).
